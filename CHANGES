    Change the name and semantics of socketpairly() née pipely2().

    The order of retrned values is changing so that it's easier to ignore
    redundant socket handles.

    Naïvely rename things internally.

    Everything still needs an editorial pass.

  Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
  Date : 2011-12-18 15:56:38 +0000

    Remove Module::Build usage.

    It adds itself to META.yml, but its presence is misleading for POE's
    purposes. POE doesn't need it to be built, configured, or installed.

    Don't fail t/00_info.t if POE::Test::Loops is unavailable.

    This test dependency is intended to be optional, and the loop tests
    should be skipped if the user doesn't want them. Problem reported by
    skbz in irc.perl.org #poe, related to cpanm installing
    POE::Test:Loops in a user-local directory but not looking there when
    installing POE.

    Make Time::HiRes a mandatory dependency. Perl has included it for
    several years now, and even older versions of Perl can install it
    from CPAN.

    Make SIGDIE asynchronous. It will no longer interrupt long chains of
    events (such as _parent/_child chains during session creation and
    destruction).

    Exceptions in _stop is currently untrappable, as the asynchronous
    SIGDIE will have nowhere to be delivered. They will cause POE::Kernel
    to "gracefully" die at the end of _stop's dispatch.

    SIGDIE propagation follows the normal rules with one new addition:
    The signal also proragates from the target session upwards through
    parent, grandparent, and so on. It will not be dispatched to children
    of ancestor sessions. It will not be dispatched to POE::Kernel
    itself.

    Nearly all regression tests pass. The notable exception is Jonathan
    Steinert's recursive signal tests. They have become moot since SIGDIE
    is not recursive anymore.

    Philip Gwyn discovered that sig_child($pid) without a corresponding
    prior sig_child($pid,"event") would drop a session's reference count
    below zero. This commit adds a new accessor to POE::Resource::Signals
    and a check whether the session is watching the PID before attempting
    to clear it. The check will slow down sig_child($pid) calls slightly,
    but they're not actually needed most of the time since POE should
    clear those one-shot events for you.

    Updated Chris Williams' fine POD tests to more explicitly treat

    skip over the methods temporarily considered private while we figure
    out whether they should really be so. Also removed tabs while I was
    in there. Curse you, tabs!

    Removed new() methods from classes that are really uninstantiated
    mixins. Calling a nonexistent method is semantically about the same
    as calling a constructor that only exists to croak. Had to remove
    tests for the croaks as well.

    Documented select_pause_read() and select_resume_read().

    Added leading underscores to a bunch of helper functions and methods
    that should really have been private. There are more to come, but
    their privacy status is less obvious.

    Add a test case (and fix) for a session garbage collection timing
    issue discoverd by Yuval Kogman. Incrementing and then decrementing
    an extra reference count could prematurely trigger a session's
    destruction. Now checks are in place to make sure it can't.

    In retrospect, it was rather dumb to rename Poll.pm to IO-Poll.pm.
    While the hyphen makes a great filesystem character, it's not very
    good for package names. Perl tends to think you're subtracting
    barewords, and things just don't work out right. This commit renames
    IO-Poll.pm to IO_Poll.pm. I hope this fixes it for good.

    Ton Hospel discovered that stop() from some event handlers causes the
    session that called it to be reaped twice. The second reap triggers
    an inconsistency error when ASSERT_DEFAULT is enabled. This patch
    adds a check to see whether a session is dead by the time its handler
    returns (and bypasses a lot of moot garbage collection in the rare
    cases that it is). It adds a performance penalty across the board.
    There's probably a better way, but this is more immediate. This patch
    also includes Ton's test case as a proper regression test.

    The last commit DID modify META.yml. The new MakeMaker generates a
    Makefile clause that creates META.yml during "make dist". That
    clobbers the more complete Build.PL version we've been using. This
    commit patches lib/Build.PL to find POE.pm in its current location.
    It also patches Makfile-5005.pm so that "make dist" does not generate
    a META.yml. Finally it commits a working META.yml.

    In the future, META.yml should come out of cvs, and "make dist"
    should generate a proper one.

    Renamed POE::Resource::Performance to POE::Resource::Statistics. The
    new form follows the POE::Resource::{plural thingy here} naming
    convention, and it opens the door for gathering statistics that may
    have nothing to do with performance. TRACE_PERFORMANCE has also been
    renamed TRACE_STATISTICS.

    Apply Nick Williams' POE::Resource::Performance class and the
    TRACE_PERFORMANCE hooks to enable runtime wallclock statistics. This
    may be extended to include CPU time inside POE::Kernel, within POE
    sessions, etc. It's still raw and experimental code; it does not
    fairly compare performance between different event loops yet. The
    various statistics have not been adequately defined, so we cannot
    verify their accuracy. The profiling code itself contributes to POE's
    overhead and may skew results against POE. Your mileage may vary.
    Small parts may present a choking hazard. Use only as directed.

    Split out the "resource" functions from POE::Kernel. The major data
    structures within POE::Kernel have been broken into subsystems and
    moved, along with their accessors, into POE::Resource::*.pm files.
    Each handles the lowest-level data management functions for its
    resource type. This is a step towards implementing XS versions of
    some of POE's hottest code, which will go a long way towards speeding
    things up in the future.

    The introduction of $handle->blocking() for ActivePerl 5.8.0 breaks
    perl 5.005_03 on two counts. First, filehandles aren't blessed into
    IO::Handle by default. Second, blocking() doesn't exist in the older
    Perl. Reintroduce the homegrown non/blocking code for legacy Perl,
    but use the portable IO::Handle version for modern Perl.

    Sergey Skvortsov reported that Driver::SysRW uses length() to count
    octets in buffers, which is broken in newer versions of Perl that

    This change adds POE/Macro/UseBytes, which is a backward-compatible
    way of including C<use bytes> in files. It also adds use_bytes

    Matt Sergeant contributed POE::Kernel::Poll, an event loop substrate
    based on IO::Poll. IO::Poll is potentially faster than select() in
    large scale servers (and other multi-connection programs). I also
    tweaked a description in the 5005 Makefile so the intent of some
    modules is more clear. Test 27_poll.t is neat, and I'm glad that it
    works. It reruns test 04_selects.t with IO::Poll loaded, forcing
    POE::Kernel::Poll to be used instead of POE::Kernel::Select.

    Revised all the manpages. Split the manpages into separate PODs, and
    put them at the end of each module. Rewnote the POE.pm overview,

    Updated the README to be more readable. Moved the mailing list and
    web site information there. Should either or both change, stale
    information won't rot in a thousand manpages around the world.

    Removed design notes from the ends of Kernel and Session, because
    docs go there now. Moved them to POE-TODO, which is now not included.

    &POE::Session::create was broken-- I'm not sure how it worked to
    begin with. Fixed.

    Revised the POE::Filter::HTTPD documentation to follow the rest of
    the manpages' format.

    (!!!) Minor interface change. &POE::Session::option can now fetch
    session option values without changing or deleting them in the
    process.

    POE::Runtime - Made this a "package" object that needs to be
    initialized. Instead of plain aliases passed through, it calls things
    like $curator->post() as objects.

    POE::Curator - Made a proper object. Vastly rewritten to be
    object-like, to do attribute security right, and to use the new
    POE::Repository::* semantics.

    POE::Repository::Array - Moved attribute compilation and object ID
    testing into here. They probably should be moved somewhere else
    later.

    POE::Object - Vastly rewrote internally, to use the vastly rewritten
    (and hopefully cleaned up) POE::Curator interface.

    samples/olayer.perl - Added attribute fetch/store and security tests.
    Commented attribute fetching and storing, with security.

    MANIFEST - Added new POE/Repository/Array.pm
